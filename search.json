For the relative cutoffs, I divided the absolute poppy cultivation area of each district by its area of irrigated land.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross all relative cutoffs there is no significant effect after Taliban takeover. For some cutoffs, significant coefficients appear in 2018 and 2019. This could point to different pre trends for districts with higher share of poppy cultivation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoppy Ban\nOn April 3 2022 the de-facto government announced a ban on Opium poppy cultivation with a two-month grace period covering the ongoing harvest.  Because of the grace period, it can be argued that the 2022 harvest was largely unaffected even though the ban was already announced. Farmers shifted towards wheat cultivation from the beginning of the sowing season around October and November 2022 . Because 80% of the opium harvest is sold by farmers within the same year it is likely that economic effects are seen in the next harvest season of 2023 .\nHence, I test two alternative event times of the ban: 2022 and in 2023.\nI expect a negative difference-in-diffrence effect on districts which cultivated opium poppy before the ban (became effective).\n\nYearly DiDYearly EvStQuarterly EvSt\n\n\n\n\n                        did_ban_22\nDependent Var.:             ln_ntl\n                                  \ntreated x post = 1 0.0016 (0.0084)\nFixed-Effects:     ---------------\ndistrict_fe                    Yes\ntime_fe                        Yes\n__________________ _______________\nS.E.: Clustered          by: GID_1\nR2                         0.97884\nObservations                   656\n---\nSignif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor 2022 ban:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor 2023 “effective” ban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarters 1 and 2 after the Taliban takeover show a positive effect, weakly significant (10%) effect.\n\n\n\n\n\nTaliban Control\nDuring the NATO mission, Afghanistan was never fully under the control of the Afghan government and its allies. I expect a positive difference-in-differences effect for districts that were already under Taliban control as of April 8, 2021 as I assumed these districts would experience less (economic) disruption.\n\n\nYearly DiDYearly EvStQuarterly EvSt\n\n\n                          did_tali\nDependent Var.: ln_ntl\ntali_cont_bin x post = 1 0.005 (0.004) Fixed-Effects: ————- GID_2 Yes year Yes ________________________ _____________ S.E.: Clustered by: GID_1 Observations 984 R2 0.97957 Within R2 0.00030 — Signif. codes: 0 ‘’ 0.001 ’’ 0.01 ’’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ’ ’ 1 did_tali\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNATO Installations\nThe NATO mission had installations in various districts across Afghanistan.
